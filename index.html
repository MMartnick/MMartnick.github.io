            <p>
                This project is a prototype for a location based ARG like the existing Pokémon Go! game. The prototype uses
                the Google Locate
                API to render different enemy characters based on the user’s location while the gameplay itself was all
                coded in vanilla
                JavaScript. The entirety of this project was built from the ground up in a week and a half and was deployed
                via Firebase
                through Git Bash. Still in ongoing development.

                      <p>
                        This is an early build of a social media website that allows the user to build a profile and update their inventory of ingredients
                        and search the Spoontastic recipe database by ingredients the user has. We integrated Passport user authentication
                        and MySQL to create a user database and retain their information. For continued scaling we plan to rework the user
                        profile for customization and image uploads. The current build has been deployed through Heroku. Still in ongoing development.

                      <p>
                        This is a GIF file search engine developed using the Giphy API. Built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this is a basic app designed
                        to show my strengths in those three areas. The project uses Ajax to get the API response and parse the data after searching
                        based on one of the default search buttons or a user generated button created through the input form. This project
                        was deployed as a git page using the Git Bash command line.
